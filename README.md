# The ClassicPress Theme

The ClassicPress Theme is the default ClassicPress theme and is based on the theme used on the ClassicPress website at https://www.classicpress.net. The ClassicPress Theme is designed to be used in three ways:
- as is, with customizations made using the Additional CSS box in the customizer and/or via plugins;
- as a starter theme, where you customize any of the code as you wish, provided that you also rename the theme and the directory in which it resides so that it does not get accidentally overwritten; or
- as a parent theme, which you customize by creating a child theme.

Please note that using the theme as-is or as a parent theme will mean that the theme may be updated from time to time alongside a ClassicPress update. This will not happen if you use it as a starter theme and re-name it as indicated above.

## Special Features
The ClassicPress Theme comes with one accessible menu. It automatically becomes a mobile menu on narrow screens.

The theme enables widgets to be added to a right sidebar, while specifying one sidebar for posts (the Blog Sidebar) and another for pages (the Main Sidebar).

The theme also enables widgets to be added to the hompepage hero section and the footer.

The hompepage hero section makes it possible to display a header image as well.
